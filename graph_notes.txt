weighted- each edge contains the sentence where the link was made

directed or undirected- word in the sentence that was used first is the source for the link and the target is the second term

obviously going to be cyclic

run calculations on the cycles?  the number of cycles involving specific nodes or clusters of nodes

The most basic thing to know about graphs is that they’re composed of vertices and edges. Vertices are the things of the graph: an integer, an object, a website, etc. Edges connect a pair of vertices.

Graphs can be:

	Weighted or unweighted — this refers to whether or not the edges of a graph are labeled with values. If they are, it’s weighted.

	Directed or undirected — this refers to whether the edge behaves like a bridge (undirected) or a bowling lane (directed).

	Cyclic or Acyclic — this refers to whether or not a cycle exists in a graph.


Adjacency List, 

{
a: [b,c,d],
b: [c,f],
d: [e],
e: [a,f],
f: [a, c, d, e]
}

or with an Adjacency Matrix, which is a two-dimensional array where edges between vertices are represented with a 1:

[ [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0] ]
