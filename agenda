User stories

i click on the root URL and the graph pops up (with a specified output that looks cool)

	- root URL performs a specified query and renders the results

i want to pick the node weight (weight of the nodes) and edge density (relative weight
of each edge by those nodes) to render

i want to click on a node an see the strongest edges that the node connects to

i want to click on a node and see the densest sentences it appears in

i want to query for the densest sentences



Agenda

Sentence Weight Calculation


WHAT IS MY MVP

Front End
	- have the rendered graph
	- need simplish set of controls- plus minus, apply
	- MVP controls - denser nodes, sections of text
	- front end receives raw data and parses/converts to graph format
	- MVPish goal- loading spinner

Data Servicing stack- MVP

	- query to back end to return specific slice of data
	- back end API to:
		- take query 
		- perform lookup
		- return to front end



	- just using "req.query" parameters
	- can load a dummy query in Express route then move to front end
	- back end API- function that takes parameters from front end, performs lookup




STRETCH GOALS
		
		- stretch goal controls-
