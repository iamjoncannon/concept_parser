How Do Android's Read Philosophy?

User stories

i click on the root URL and the graph pops up (with a specified output that looks cool)

	- root URL performs a specified query and renders the results

i want to choose between the whole book and one section in the book

	- would have to create separate edge weight tables for each section and then query those

i want to pick the node weight (weight of the nodes) and edge density (relative weight of each edge by those nodes) to render

	- filter and color code edges by density 

i want to click on a node and see the densest sentences it appears in

	- click on node and sidebar pops up to the left with all the sentences it appears in, sorted by

i want to query for the densest sentences

	- separate DAT gui folder with sentence queries, appears in side bar

i want to see a loading message bewteen calling the api and the
data being loaded 




Agenda

Edge Weight Table

Sentence Weight Calculation


WHAT IS MY MVP

Front End
	- have the rendered graph
	- need simplish set of controls- plus minus, apply
	- MVP controls - denser nodes, sections of text
	- front end receives raw data and parses/converts to graph format
	- MVPish goal- loading spinner

Data Servicing stack- MVP

	- query to back end to return specific slice of data
	- back end API to:
		- take query 
		- perform lookup
		- return to front end



	- just using "req.query" parameters
	- can load a dummy query in Express route then move to front end
	- back end API- function that takes parameters from front end, performs lookup




STRETCH GOALS
		
		- stretch goal controls-
